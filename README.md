The 2016 FDA Naloxone App Competition, a prize competition under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (COMPETES Act), is an effort to help reduce deaths associated with prescription opioid and heroin overdose by seeking innovative approaches to help reduce preventable harm associated with opioids.  Specifically, the goal of this Competition is to spur innovation around the development of a low-cost, scalable, crowd-sourced mobile phone application that helps increase the likelihood that opioid users, their immediate personal networks, and first responders are able to identify and react to an overdose by administering naloxone, a medication that reverses the effects of opioid overdose.  Participants in the Code-a-thon held on October 19-20, 2016 have provided their code in FDAâ€™s repository.
